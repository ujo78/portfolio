# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves completely revamping the third project section on the portfolio landing page and its corresponding detailed project page. Currently, this section showcases a "Biomedical image collaboration" project (Slice), but we want to replace it with a new, more relevant project that better represents Rakshit Raj's software engineering skills and experience. The new project should maintain the existing visual theme, design patterns, and technical implementation approach while showcasing different technologies and achievements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the home page THEN the third project section SHALL display a new project with updated title, description, and visual assets
2. WHEN a user clicks the "View project" button THEN they SHALL be redirected to a completely new detailed project page
3. WHEN the new project loads THEN it SHALL maintain the same visual design patterns and theme as existing projects
4. WHEN viewed on different devices THEN the new project SHALL be fully responsive and accessible

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a portfolio visitor, I want to see detailed information about the new project, so that I can understand the technical implementation, challenges solved, and outcomes achieved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the detailed project page THEN they SHALL see comprehensive project information including overview, technical details, and outcomes
2. WHEN viewing the project details THEN the page SHALL include multiple high-quality images showcasing the project
3. WHEN reading the project description THEN it SHALL clearly explain the problem solved, approach taken, and technologies used
4. WHEN viewing project outcomes THEN they SHALL see measurable results and impact of the work

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer reviewing the portfolio, I want to see a project that demonstrates relevant modern technologies, so that I can assess technical competency in current industry standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the new project THEN it SHALL showcase technologies relevant to Rakshit's target roles (Python, Java, Web Development, ML, etc.)
2. WHEN examining the technical approach THEN it SHALL demonstrate best practices in software architecture and development
3. WHEN viewing the project implementation THEN it SHALL show problem-solving skills and technical depth
4. WHEN reading about the project THEN it SHALL include specific technical challenges and how they were overcome

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a potential employer or client, I want to see a project with real-world impact, so that I can understand the practical value of Rakshit's work.

2. WHEN examining project outcomes THEN they SHALL include quantifiable metrics and improvements
3. WHEN reading the project story THEN it SHALL show end-to-end ownership from conception to deployment
4. WHEN viewing the project details THEN they SHALL include user feedback or adoption metrics where applicable

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a portfolio maintainer, I want the new project to integrate seamlessly with the existing codebase, so that the site remains maintainable and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the new project THEN it SHALL reuse existing components and design patterns
2. WHEN updating the home page THEN it SHALL maintain the same ProjectSummary component structure
