## Asset Specifications

### Image Dimensions
- Standard: 800x600 (main), varies for others
- Large: 1920x1440 (main), proportionally larger for others
- Placeholder: Low resolution, optimized for fast loading

### Content Descriptions
Each asset represents different aspects of the Indian Traffic Digital Twin:

1. **Main Images**: 3D traffic simulation with mixed Indian vehicles, real-time analytics, MATLAB integration status
2. **Analytics**: Traffic flow analysis, congestion metrics, performance data
3. **MATLAB**: RoadRunner integration, Simulink co-simulation, data streaming
4. **Scenarios**: Emergency simulations, traffic optimization comparisons
5. **Architecture**: System design, Python/Panda3D integration, technical stack
6. **Background**: Atmospheric simulation scenes for hero sections
7. **Mobile**: Responsive design adaptations

### Usage Notes
- All assets follow the existing portfolio naming convention
- Placeholder files are optimized for progressive loading
- Large versions support high-DPI displays
- Mobile versions ensure responsive design compatibility

## Next Steps
These placeholder files should be replaced with actual screenshots of the 3D traffic simulation system once the project images are captured or generated.
